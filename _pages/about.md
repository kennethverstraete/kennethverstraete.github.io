[Hello there!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaEMSKzqGAg) I'm Kenneth Verstraete, a PhD researcher at the KU Leuven in Belgium.

Research
======


Master's theses
======
To obtain my Master in Engineering Science: Computer Science (2017), I performed a master's thesis under the supervision of [prof. Nick Vannieuwenhoven](https://people.cs.kuleuven.be/~nick.vannieuwenhoven/) at the Numerical Analysis and Applied Mathematics (NUMA) research unit of KU Leuven.
During this thesis, I explored tensor decompositions (the Tucker decomposition in particular) to extract features from the famous MNIST dataset to classify handwritten digits.

For the completion of my advanced Master in Artificial Intelligence (2019), I continued my work on tensor decompositions and explored the use of the canonical polyadic decomposition to extract patterns in soccer player data from the FIFA video games.
I was mentored by [Tom Decroos](https://tomdecroos.github.io/) under the supervision of [prof. Jesse Davis](https://people.cs.kuleuven.be/~jesse.davis/) from the DTAI research group and [prof. Nick Vannieuwenhoven](https://people.cs.kuleuven.be/~nick.vannieuwenhoven/) from the NUMA research unit.
