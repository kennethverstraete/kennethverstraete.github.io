This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).

Research

Master's theses
======
To obtain my Master in Engineering Science: Computer Science (2017), I performed a master's thesis under the supervision of [prof. Nick Vannieuwenhoven](https://people.cs.kuleuven.be/~nick.vannieuwenhoven/) at the Numerical Analysis and Applied Mathematics (NUMA) research unit of KU Leuven.
During this thesis, I explored tensor decompositions (the Tucker decomposition in particular) to extract features from the famous MNIST dataset to classify handwritten digits.

For the completion of my advanced Master in Artificial Intelligence (2019), I continued my work on tensor decompositions and explored the use of the canonical polyadic decomposition to extract patterns in soccer player data from the FIFA video games.
I was mentored by [Tom Decroos](https://tomdecroos.github.io/) under the supervision of [prof. Jesse Davis](https://people.cs.kuleuven.be/~jesse.davis/) from the DTAI research group and [prof. Nick Vannieuwenhoven](https://people.cs.kuleuven.be/~nick.vannieuwenhoven/) from the NUMA research unit.
